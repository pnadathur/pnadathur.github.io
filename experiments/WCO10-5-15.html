<p class="block-text"> Given an ambiguous description of a situation,
	people are very good at using contextual information to figure
	out what or who is being talked about.  We are trying to
	generate a system that mimics this behavior: in this survey,
	you will help improve this system by answering comprehension
	questions about some short scenarios.</p>


<p class="block-text">There are <span class="numquestions">{{}}</span> questions. The HIT should take around <span id="totaltime">{{}}</span> minutes to complete.</p>

  <p class="block-text"> We invite you to participate in a research study on language
  production and comprehension.  Your experimenter will ask you to do
  a linguistic task such as reading sentences or words, naming
  pictures or describing scenes, making up sentences of your own, or
  participating in a simple language game.<br> <br>
  There are no risks or benefits of any kind involved in this
  study. <br> <br>

		<br>In this HIT you will help us improve a system
	which resolves ambiguity based on contextual cues. You'll see <span class="numquestions">{{}}</span>
	short paragraphs describing a situation.  Your task is to
	answer a comprehension question about this situation.</p>

		<p class="blurb">For example, you might see a description like this:</p>
		<p>Kate's boss imposed a strict dress code for the office.  Men had to wear 
coats and ties and women were prohibited from wearing pants.  One of
		the women Kate worked with began looking for other
		jobs, because she hated the new policy. </p>

<p class="blurb">When you have finished reading the paragraph, click
  the "Show Question" button to display the comprehension question.  A
  question about the paragraph will appear, for example: </>
  <p class="txt"><strong>Who hated the new policy?</strong></p>
<p class="blurb"> Pick the answer that best matches your understanding
  of the short passage, and indicate your answer
  by clicking the appropriate button.</p>

      <h2>course information (schedule below)</h2>
    <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Prerna Nadathur  <a href="mailto:prerna.nadathur@phil.hhu.de">[email]</a></p>
    <p><b>Office:</b> 24.53.00.87 (Department office: 24.53.00.86)</p>
      <p><b>Schedule:</b> Weds 14.30-16.00
	<p><b>Location:</b>  22.01, H\"{o}rsaal 2A</p>

      <p><b>Course policies and requirements:</b> <br>
	  <ol> <li><b>Assessment<br><br></b>
	      <ul> <li><b> Beteiligungsnachweis/Kreditpunkte (2 ECTS):</b> In order to get a BN, you must receive at least 50% of the available homework points, and turn in more than 75% of the homework assignments.</li>
		<li> <b>Abschlusspr&uuml;fung (6 ECTS):</b> In order to qualify for the AP, you must take and pass a  written exam.  Doing the homework is not required for the AP; however, doing the homework is the only way to get the practice that you need for the final exam, and is strongly encouraged if you would like to take the AP.<br><br></li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li> <b>Tutors</b> <br>
		Each student has been assigned to one tutor, alphabetically by your last name.  The assignments are below:<br><br>
		
	  <table>
	    <tr> <th style="text-align: center;">Last name</th> <th style="text-align: center;">Tutor</th> <th style="text-align: center;">Email</th> </tr>
	    <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">A-G</td>
	      <td style="text-align: center;">Sophia Ke&szlig;ler</td>
	      <td style="text-align:center;"><a href="mailto:sophia.kessler@hhu.de">sophia.kessler@hhu.de</a></td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">H-Kr&auml;</td>
	      <td style="text-align: center;">Anna Stahlich</td>
	      <td></td> 
	    </tr>
	    <tr>  <td style="text-align: center;">Kr&uuml;-Schi</td>
	      <td style="text-align: center;">Linda Steppan</td>
	      <td></td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">Schm-Z</td>

	 </table><br>
	    There are no tutorials for this class.  You can communicate with your tutor via email.  If you have questions about class content, schedule, or organization, you should first email your tutor.  They are also a good resource for questions about assignments or for general tips about how to study for and prepare for the coursework. <br>
	      Please be realistic in your expectations, and allow your tutor time to think about your question before responding.  If you email your tutor outside of working hours, or on the weekend, you may not get a response until the next working day. In general, for homework questions, it is a good idea to be in touch with your tutor well before an assignment is due -- if you email themthe night before, they may simply not have enough time to give you feedback. <br><br>
	    </li>
		<li> <b> Office hours </b><br>
		    The tutors will hold office hours once a week, time TBD.  You are welcome and encouraged to attend office hours as often as you wish.  It is a good idea to email the tutor responsible for office hours with your questions in advance, so that they can be better prepared to assist you (and so that they can let me know if there is a particular question which I should discuss in lecture).  <br><br></li>
		      <li> <b> Homework</b> <br>
			  This class has very regular homework, and it is a very good idea to attempt the assignments if you want to get the most out of this class.  They will consist of a set of questions and computations related to the material from class.  You will usually have one week to complete an assignment, unless otherwise indicated.  <br>
			    Course materials, including assignments,  will be in English, and you are strongly encouraged to complete your assignments in English.  Note that you will not be penalized for any errors relating to English grammar.  If you need to complete assignments in German, please let me know before the first assignment is due.<br>
			      You should type your assignments, print them out, and bring them to class with you.  We will often discuss them in class, so late assignments will not be accepted (in the absence of suitable justification, such as a doctor's note). The only exception to this is if you arrive late to class, bringing your assignment with you; however, assignments submitted late because of late arrival will automatically be worth 20% less.  If you cannot come to class on the day an assignment is due, you may put the assignment in the box labeled "Semantik" in the Sekretariat der Allgemeinen Sprachwissenschaft & Computerlinguistik (24.53.00.86).  Corrected homework can be picked up in the Sekretariat the week after it was due.<br><br>
				<ul> <li>	<b>Note on collaboration:</b> You are encouraged to work with other students to solve the homework problems.  However, you MUST write your solutions independently.  If you work with another student on an assignment, you should indicate this on the assignment.  Assignments that are identical in part or in full to another student's assignment will not be accepted. <br><br> </li></ul>
				    </li>
				    <li> <b>Attendance</b> <br>
					Attendance is not required, but it is strongly recommended.  We will often go over practice problems or do in-class exercises that will help you with the assignments and with the final exam, should you choose to take it.  In general, the more you participate in class, the more you will get out of it.<br>
					  Please be courteous to your fellow students when you are in class.  You may of course use a laptop or electronic device to take notes, but please refrain from non-class-related activities.  If you arrive late to class, please come in quietly.
